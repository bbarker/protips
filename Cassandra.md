# Cassandra
- a row only accumulates storage space for non-null values, so it is sparse, in a sense.
- partition key, then clustering column, divides up data.
- frequently, the primary key is composed of the partition key and contact time (I think)

# cqlsh
- supports tab completion
- 

# Testing
- nosqlbench can be used for testing a db under load
