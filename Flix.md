# Datalog
> Datalog is well-suited for "fixpoint computations on relations and lattice". This can also be phrased as "dynamic programming problems". It is not ideal for search problems or optimization problems, e.g. finding a minimum/maximum value, unless it is a dynamic programming problem. Yet another phrase would be "reachability problems on graphs" Note that shortest paths in a graph is an optimization problem, but one that can be solved by dynamic programming / with Datalog+lattices. The average Flix program will probably not have more than a few percent of Datalog. It is a powerful tool, but should only be used when relevant.
